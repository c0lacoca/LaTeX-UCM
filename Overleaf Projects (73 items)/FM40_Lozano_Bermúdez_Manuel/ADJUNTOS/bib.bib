abstract = {Despite of the numerous theoretical and experimental investigations on the mechanical properties of graphene as a unique nano-structured material, a precious value for this important property has not yet been presented. In the present work, the Young’s modulus of single layer graphene sheet has been investigated by using comprehensive classic as well as quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. Molecular mechanics (MM) approach with various well-defined force-fields such as AIREBO, Tresoff and EDIP potentials have been considered. In QM category, several conventional methods (DFTB and DFT-LDA/GGA) have been employed. The results show that EDIP potential method predicts more accurately the graphene Young’s modulus value compared to experimental results. Furthermore, despite the various theoretical results reported elsewhere, the EDIP potential calculations result reveals that Young’s modulus has the same value at both zigzag and armchair directions. From the results obtained here, we found that among the various MM and QM methods considered here the EDIP method seems to be the most convenient method for evaluation of both structural geometries and mechanical properties of carbon based graphene-like materials. This is because of its less computational costs accompanied with reliable results comparable with the experiments.}

abstract = {We describe monocrystalline graphitic films, which are a few atoms thick but are nonetheless stable under ambient conditions, metallic, and of remarkably high quality. The films are found to be a two-dimensional semimetal with a tiny overlap between valence and conductance bands, and they exhibit a strong ambipolar electric field effect such that electrons and holes in concentrations up to 1013 per square centimeter and with room-temperature mobilities of ∼10,000 square centimeters per volt-second can be induced by applying gate voltage.}}
